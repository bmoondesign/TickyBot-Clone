# TickyBot-Clone
Clone for TickyBot on Slack (https://tickybott.herokuapp.com/)

This is my first project for Chingu (https://www.chingu.io/) which is cloning TickyBot website (link above).
Colors have been slightly modified and site is optimized for all device sizes.

The site includes:
- an introduction of TickyBot for Slack
- TickyBot features
- a link to install TickyBot
- back to top button for easy scrolling 

Note: Some images have been replaced with others and CSS animation for robot hasn't been implemented.
